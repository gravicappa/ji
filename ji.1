.SH NAME
ji \- jabber it

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ji
is a minimalistic FIFO and filesystem based XMPP client.
It creates a xmpp directory tree with server and contact jid directories.
In every directory a FIFO file (\fIin\fP)) and a normal file (\fIout\fP) is
placed.
The \fIin\fP file is used to communicate with contact and the \fIout\fP file
includes messages. Fore every opened chat there will be new \fIin\fP and
\fIout\fP files.
The basic idea of this is to be able to communicate with a XMPP server with
basic command line tools.
For example if you will open a chat with a contact do 
.br
.B "echo '/j contact@server' > in"
.br
and ji creates a new chat directory with \fIin\fP and \fIout\fP files.
