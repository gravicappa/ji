.Nm ji
.Op Fl j Ar jid
.Op Fl r Ar prefix
.Op Fl s Ar servername
.Op Fl n Ar nick
.Op Fl e Ar event-fifo

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a minimalistic FIFO and filesystem based XMPP client. It creates a xmpp
directory tree with server and contact jid directories. In every directory a
FIFO file
.Pa ( in )
and a normal file
.Pa ( out )
is placed.
The 
.Pa in
file is used to communicate with contact and the
.Pa out
file includes messages. For every opened chat there will be
new 
.Pa in
and 
.Pa out
files.
The basic idea of this is to be able to communicate with a XMPP server with
basic command line tools.
For example if you will open a chat with a contact do 

.Dl echo '/j contact@server' > in

and 
.Nm
creates a new chat directory with 
.Pa in 
and 
.Pa out 
files.

.Bl -tag
.It Ar -j jid
specifies your JID in form 
.Em user@server/resource

.It Ar -r prefix
overrides the default jabber path
.Pa ( $HOME/talk ) .

.It Ar -s servername
overrides server name specified in JID.

.It Ar -n nick
overrides your default nickname appearing in history files 
.Em ( me ) .

.It Ar -e event-fifo
specifies fifo for notifications.
.El

.Nm
reads password from standard input.

.Sh DIRECTORIES
.Pa $HOME/talk
.Pp
In this directory the jabber tree will be created which contains FIFO,
the output file and contacts directories. If you open a chat with
someone (or vice versa) a new directory with the name of collocutor's
JID will be created in the 
.Pa $HOME/talk
directory.
